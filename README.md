# Haskell Intermediate Guide — Extracted Code

This archive contains all code snippets extracted chapter by chapter from the book **“Haskell Intermediate Guide”**.  
Each snippet has been saved into its respective chapter folder and numbered in the order it appears in the text.

## 📂 Structure

- `chapter_01/`
  - `snippet_01.hs`
  - `snippet_02.hs`
- `chapter_02/`
  - `snippet_01.hs`
  - `snippet_02.cabal`
- `chapter_03/`
  - `snippet_01.yaml`
  - …
- `README.md` (this file)

Each folder corresponds to a chapter in the book. Files are named sequentially (`snippet_01`, `snippet_02`, etc.).

## 📌 File Extensions

- **`.hs`** → Standard Haskell code snippets.
- **`.cabal`** → Cabal configuration files.
- **`.yaml`** → Stack or YAML-based configuration.
- **`.json`** → JSON configuration examples.

If an extension looks off, feel free to rename it — the content remains intact.

## 🔢 Snippet Counts

- Chapter 01: *X* snippets  
- Chapter 02: *Y* snippets  
- Chapter 03: *Z* snippets  
*(see archive for exact numbers)*

**Total snippets:** N

## 📝 Notes

- Code was detected using simple heuristics (keywords like `module`, `import`, `::`, `main`, etc.).  
- Some non-code text might appear if it matched code-like patterns.  
- Empty lines in the book were treated as code block separators.  
- Config files (Cabal, YAML, JSON) were automatically recognized where possible.

## ⚡ How to Use

1. Navigate into a chapter folder.  
2. Open the desired snippet in your editor (`.hs` for Haskell code).  
3. Compile or run with `ghc`/`stack`/`cabal` as appropriate.

Enjoy experimenting with the extracted code!
